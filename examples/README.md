# Examples for `snopy` package

In this directory you can find some useful examples of how to work with the package. It was prepared to be as much intuitive as possible, although users may benefit from prepared use-cases templates.

## Getting your Snowflake account ID

To get your Snowflake account ID (essential to connect), please refer to [Account Identifiers in Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier.html). There are several methods to get your account ID, but the overall rule can be found below:

```<account_identifier>.snowflakecomputing.com```

If you're proceeding with the trial account, it's highly probable that your ID will resemble something like: `xy1234.eu-central-1`.

## Snowflake trial account

If you don't have your SF account, you can easily set up a [45-day trial account with $400 budget here](https://signup.snowflake.com/) to play around with the tool before paying anything.
